This module provides functionality to send an email with an attachment using Gmail's SMTP server.

Functions:
- is_valid_email(email): Validates if the provided email address matches the standard email format.
- send_email_with_attachment(): Sends an email with a PDF attachment to a recipient
email address specified in environment variables.

Dependencies:
- os: For accessing environment variables.
- re: For regular expression matching.
- smtplib: For sending emails using the SMTP protocol.
- email: For constructing email messages with attachments.
- uuid: For generating unique identifiers.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables from a .env file.
- services.utils: For getting the project root directory.
